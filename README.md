Disclaimer
----------
**Klooni 1010!** is a [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)-based game
which is a *klooni* from the original [1010!](http://1010ga.me/) game by the
[Gram Games](http://gram.gs/) team. I am **not affiliated** in any way with
them and this is only a project I made for fun, and to improve the gaming
experience of the open source community. If you really enjoy playing this,
**please support the original developers**. They made this project possible.

Description
-----------
*Klooni 1010!* is an open source copy of *1010!* with the same game-play
dynamics of the original game. I tried to mimic it as much as possible,
yet, not everything is exactly the same. For example, the customize screen
is different, there are no ads or in-app purchases, different sounds, etc.
